title: orpc 0.3
---

I am happy to announce version 0.3 of `orpc`, a tool for generating
RPC bindings from OCaml signatures. Orpc can generate ONC RPC stubs
for use with
[Ocamlnet](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html) (in
place of ocamlrpcgen), and it can also generate RPC over HTTP stubs
for use with [ocamljs](http://github.com/jaked/ocamljs). You can use
most OCaml types in interfaces, as well as exceptions and
labelled/optional arguments.

Changes since version 0.2 include

 * a way to use types defined outside the interface file, so you can
   use a type in more than one interface
 * support for polymorphic variants
 * a way to specify "abstract" interfaces that can be instantiated for
   synchronous, asynchronous, and Lwt clients and servers
 * bug fixes

Development of `orpc` has moved from Google Code to Github; see

 * [project page](http://github.com/jaked/orpc)
 * [documentation](http://jaked.github.com/orpc)
 * [downloads](http://github.com/jaked/orpc/downloads)

Let me know what you think.
